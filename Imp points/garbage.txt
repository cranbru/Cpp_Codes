Garbage values occur in programming languages like C and C++ when variables are declared but not initialized. When a variable is created, it occupies a specific memory location, and if it hasn't been assigned a value, it retains whatever data was previously stored at that address. This residual data can lead to unpredictable behavior in programs, as the garbage value can vary with each execution, particularly for local variables. In contrast, global and static variables are automatically initialized to zero, preventing the occurrence of garbage values.
