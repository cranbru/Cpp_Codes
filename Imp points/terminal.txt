THE ./a.out we use in this
the ./ is telling that take the current directory 
and a.out is telling to run the executable



to make the executable file name something specific

you can use -o while compiling 

EG:-
        g++ mycode.cpp -o myprogram

now to run the file named myprogram ./myprogram
